    <span>DEV NOTE:</span>
    We wanted to provide a landing page for each text group that would not
    merely list the available works but provide data about the text group
    as a whole (both general and customized to the authenticated user if
    appropriate). This is just a placeholder for now, so DOES just list the
    available works, but during the development process, it can evolve to
    include things like metadata, activity feeds, visualisations, and
    actions that the user can take. Exactly how to display works is still
    to be established.
